## TCR alpha beta pairing preference study

All analysis and figures used in the manuscript were produced using the Rmd files available in the repository. 
Those files are to be run using [RStudio](rstudio.com) IDE. 
Note that a number of R packages (loaded by calling the `library(.)` function at the beginning of Rmd file) should be installed in order to run these notebooks.
After that, Rmd notebooks can be run to reproduce the analysis.
